# parrot-party-clicker

An Activity to practice adding behaviors and event handling to our projects.

## Directions
Add javascript code to Party Parrot Clicker such that:

1. A click on the Party Parrot increases the counter by 1
2. Add a button called ‘reset’ that will reset the click count to ‘0’.
3. Add an effect whenever the clickCount reaches a specific number. (Ex: make parrot bigger, smaller, change the text/emoji, etc.)

## Extra:
- Box 1: When the mouse hovers over Box 1, switch the background to pink
- Box 2: When the spacebar is pressed down, make the text in Box 2 turn into a flan emoji
- Box 3: When Box 3 is clicked on, make Party Parrot appear and disappear
- Box 4: When Box 4 is double clicked, an alert shows up
